</body>Coyotes are very visible and active during the last part of Summer and the start of Fall – known in the wildlife world as dispersal season. Pups born earlier in the Spring are venturing out and about, and adults are on the move now that the pups can be on their own. SFACC receives more sightings reports during dispersal season than during most other months. These sightings reports are reviewed by the City’s Wildlife Working Group which is made up of staff from SFACC, SF Recreation & Parks, and the Presidio Trust.  

Coyote pups that end up in unfamiliar areas and get themselves in a pickle are often helped out of their predicaments by our team of Animal Control Officers. A recent rescue helped out both a coyote AND a homeowner who didn’t really want a coyote tenant. The pup got himself stuck in a backyard and was too frightened to move. The homeowner called in SFACC. Animal Control Officers rescued the pup and sent him on his way in a more appropriate area. 

Along with the increase in coyote activity and sightings comes the potential for more conflict. SFACC strongly advises residents to keep cats indoors at all times. Dog should always be on leash, and guardians should remain vigilant when outside. Small dog guardians should be prepared to pick up their dog and slowly walk away if they see a coyote.
